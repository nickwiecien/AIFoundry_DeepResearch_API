    "# Deep Research Agent Creation Notebook\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how to create a Deep Research Agent using the **Azure AI Agents Service** in **Azure AI Foundry**. It includes only the minimal steps required to provision an agent capable of performing grounded deep research with Bing and a deployed deep research model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load and validate required environment variables\n",
    "2. Initialize the Azure AI Project client (Agents Service)\n",
    "3. Resolve the Bing grounding connection\n",
    "4. Initialize the Deep Research tool\n",
    "5. Define concise agent instructions\n",
    "6. Create the agent with tool definitions\n",
    "7. Output the resulting `agent.id` for reuse (set it as `AGENT_ID` in your environment later)\n",

    "> After creation, use the printed `AGENT_ID` when calling your API's `/research/submit` endpoint.\n"
